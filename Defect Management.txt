1. What is Defect ?
-> Defect is the variance from a desired product attribute (it can be a wrong, missing or extra data).

2. Types of Defect ?
-> Data Quality/Database Defects: Deals with improper handling of data in the database.
- Critical Functionality Defects: The occurrence of these bugs hampers the crucial functionality of the application. 
- Functionality Defects: These defects affect the functionality of the application.
- Security Defects: Application security defects generally involve improper handling of data sent from the user to the application.
- User Interface Defects: As the name suggests, the bugs deal with problems related to UI are usually considered less severe.

3. What is Bug(Defect) Life Cycle.
-> “A computer bug is an error, flaw, mistake, failure, or fault in a computer program that prevents it from working correctly or
produces an incorrect result. Bugs arise from mistakes and errors, made by people, in either a program’s source code or its design.”

4. Defect Stages.
-> 1. New
   2. Assigned
   3. Open
   4. Fixed
   5. Pending retest
   6. Retest

5. What is Defect Severity.
-> Severity is absolute and Customer-Focused. It is the extent to which the defect can affect the software. In other words it defines the
   impact that a given defect has on the system.
- Critical: The defect that results in the termination of the complete system or one or more component of the 
  system and causes extensive corruption of the data.

6. Defect Priority ?
-> Priority is Relative and Business-Focused. Priority defines the order in which we should resolve a defect.

7. Scenario of Defect Priority - Severity .
-> High Priority & High Severity: An error which occurs on the basic functionality of the application and will not allow the user to use the system.
(Eg. A site maintaining the student details, on saving record if it, doesn’t allow to save the record then this is high priority and high severity bug.)
- High Priority & Low Severity: The spelling mistakes that happens on the cover page or heading or title of an application.
- High Severity & Low Priority: An error which occurs on the functionality of the application (for which there is no workaround) and will not allow the
  user to use the system but on click of link which is rarely used by the end user.
- Low Priority and Low Severity: Any cosmetic or spelling issues which is within a paragraph or in the report (Not on cover page, heading, title).
